# tech-crashcourse

Hi, my friend! As a software engineer, sometimes I have to pick up some tech-related concepts or skills in a short time and the most effective way I find is by self-learning. 

As a non-English speaker, I feel the strong need for promoting my English skills to become a more efficient learner, since most of learning materials I've found helpful on the Internet is written in English. 

The best thing of taking notes in English is that it helps me achieve both goals. Besides, sharing my notes to all of you makes the whole learning process even worthier. I'd like to hear from you, which makes me feel connected to the outside world.

Now, let us join my coding adventure!
